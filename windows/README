This contains the source code and executable for the Stone Ridge DNS modifier
that runs on windows.

You need to have .NET Framework v4 installed to run the service.

It's C#. To build it (if you really feel like building your own copy, or if you
want to change things), create a new C# console project in Visual Studio.
Overwrite the file it generates with srdns.cs from this directory. You need to
add a reference to the System.ServiceProcess assembly to your project before
you build this (in the Solution Explorer, right-click on "References", select
"Add Reference", and then on the .NET tab, select "System.ServiceProcess" and
hit "OK").

Your resulting exe can be added as a service using sc.exe (see
install.py for an example of the command line used).

Enjoy
