# What IP address to use for the test network interface
MYIP=172.16.1.1

# What interface is attached to the test network
MYDEV=eth1

### THESE ITEMS APPLY ONLY TO STONE RIDGE SERVERS
# What data rate to shape the interface to
# Broadband:
RATE=10mbit
# UMTS:
#RATE=1mbit
# GSM:
#RATE=400kbit

# MAXBURST and LIMIT help to smooth traffic out over a full bucket period,
# to prevent things from being bursty. MAXBURST should be the either the rate
# reduced by an SI prefix (so 10mbit->10240) or 1600, whichever is larger.
# LIMIT should be MAXBURST*3
# Broadband:
MAXBURST=10240
LIMIT=30720
# UMTS/GSM:
#MAXBURST=1600
#LIMIT=4800

# What sort of latency to have on the interface.
# Broadband:
LATENCY=90ms
# UMTS:
#LATENCY=150ms
# GSM:
#LATENCY=300ms

# JITTER and CORRELATION control jitter on the interface. JITTER is the
# average number of ms of jitter, while CORRELATION is how similar a packet's
# actual jitter will be to the previous packet's jitter
# Broadband:
JITTER=
CORRELATION=
# UMTS:
#JITTER=20ms
#CORRELATION="25%"
# GSM:
#JITTER=40ms
#CORRELATION="25%"

# What network configuration the above settings correspond to
NETCONFIG=broadband

### THESE ITEMS APPLY ONLY TO STONE RIDGE CLIENTS
# These are the IP addresses and ethernet MAC addresses for each of the
# network configurations. This allows us to have static ARP entries for
# these machines, which makes the tests take the expected amount of time for
# the latencies involved.
